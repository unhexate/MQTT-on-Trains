This project aims to implement a basic version of the MQTT protocol, and simulate communication within a train network. 

Inspired by https://iot.eclipse.org/community/resources/case-studies/pdf/Eclipse%20IoT%20Success%20Story%20-%20DB.pdf

broker.py should contain code for the broker
client.py should contain code for clients
